In this project, we had to clean and analyse the Employee Exit Survey results from the Queensland government in Australia's Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body. You can find the TAFE exist survey statistics here as well as the DETE exit survey results here.

We specifically sought clarification on the following issues:

Are those who have only recently worked for the institutes departing out of some sort of dissatisfaction? How about those who have been there longer?

Are younger workers leaving the company out of some sort of dissatisfaction? What about senior staff members?


To respond to the questions above, we chose to combine the two datasets that contained the findings from both surveys. However, even though they both utilised the same survey template, one of them changed a few of the responses, which complicated our task.
